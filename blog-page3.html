                    <p>
                        Mohammed Sherif is a young Egyptain phototographer, who is skilled in street photography, nut specialises in 
                        coneptuual fashion street photography. I got the chance to have a workshop with this skilled artist. The workshop 
                        was an onground workshop where we were in West El Balad and go the full experience of what it is like to shot among
                         citizens living in the area.
                    </p>

                        He taught me the idea of applying a number of elements into one photograph beacuse it creates a sense of layering
                         that builds up a story behind every element. Inn addition to the layering technique, the key is to make the model act 
                         in their own nature to fit the asthetics of the place, but at the same time create a sense of contradicting contrast.
                    </p>

                            This is one of the pictures I took in the workshop and the thing here is that he is wearing modern clothes in
                            an old area, which creates an interesting contrast.
                            When two opposite elements are present at same place, they create a story that one cannot put into words.
                           <span> This is one of the goals that we tried to implement in the workshop. You will find in the photography section 
                            in this website more of the work that I made in this interesting workshop.</span>
