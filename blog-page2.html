                        George and Samuel Mohsen are two photographers  work as photo journalists, wedding and aritchural photographers. 
                        I had a chance to learn the basics of photography through a workshop I attended with them. They taught me everything
                        with ease from start to finish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was able to learn the history of photography from how it started with the daguerreotypes, calotypes, dry plates, film 
                        and ended with today DSLR cameas and phone cameras that takes a picture in a matter of seconds. Not only did I get the chance 
                        to learn more about cameras, but I also got the chance to learn a bit of the techniques of framming and fishing within a shot.
                        Framing is basically using the shadows and highlights of the surrounding elements and making a frame with it. As for fishing, 
                        it is the act inwish one has to be aware of the surrounding elements and living things to be able to take a shot at the right
                        time; similar to the idea of layering elements in the same photograph.

                        <p>
                            <span>This is one of the shots that I am very proud of, as I was able to apply both fishing and framing in one single shot after a 
                            number of tries in the second workshop.</span>
                           As you can see, the frame was created by the shadows of the tree and surrounding buildings and the people who were in the shot 
                           were fished. In otherwords, I had to stay for a while to find the right people to pass buy this executed frame.
                           <span class="advice">Patience and a good eye catcher are the key elemnts in this style of photography.</span>

                            <p class="img-paragh">The key here is to make the shadows and highlights work harmoniously
                                 toegther to create some form of depth.
                            </p>
                            <p class="img-paragh">TIP: if the pictures are under exposed (dark in color), it can be fixed by using any editing
                                program, but id over exposed (techniquelly burned and too bright), it is very hard to fix it back.
                            </p>
                            <p class="img-paragh">These are other shots I took, which revolve around the idea of applying shadows and highlights , but at the same
                                 time appying the right exposure and camera settings( ISO, aperature and shutter speed).
